## What I learned
During the development of this project I have learned to use various new thing as well as to improve existing skills. I learned how to user TensorFlow lite which help in enabling on device
machine learning which was used to develop facial recongnition model, Firebase ML kit which was used in facial identification and Firebase Storage to store all the images remotly where 
firestore was used to store text data. I have also written more complex algorithm while developing the appilication for proper functioning of the facial recognition.
